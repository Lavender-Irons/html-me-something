                        I love working on all types of projects. I sew various medians; felt, cross-stitch, 
                        quilt, stuffed animals, and cloths. I create different things with my Cricut; signs, 
                        cups, t-shirts. Every Christmas I add more to my Nightmare Before Christmas decorations. 
                        I build and remodel around the house. And, every Halloween, I create and put up more decorations
                        but somehow keep more and more up year round. I am the weird one in my family; my partner and 
                        children just shake thier head and accept me for me.

                I bought my house in 2014. My 27 year old daughter, 9 year old grandson, and 14 year old son all live with me.
                I try to work on various projects all the time. I have experience with building and remodeling due to my dad owning his own 
                construction company. Here are a few of my projects I have completed.

                        Some home improvement projects I have made. The shelf is hanging on the pantry door.
                        I built my headboard for under $100 and it would have been over $1500 in the store. I used
                        fence boards to create a sliding barn door. The valance above my window was created from
                        cardboard and material. And I have to give my daughter a lot of credit for our garden.

                It is fun being able to make gifts for my love ones. I not only get to give them a one of a kind
                item, love is put into every stich. Yes, there is a lot of blood(because I always tend to injure
                myself) a lot of cursing, and occasionally some frustration. I would not have it any other way. It
                is a joy to watch them open the gift to see what I created for them.

                        The animals were for my grandson, he loves a game app called Mope.io. I end up creating
                        over 100 different animals from this game. He also took a page from my book and was going
                        through a phase where he wanted to watch horror movies, so I made him Chucky, Freddie, and 
                        the clown from IT. I made my son all of the video game items. He now has a game room in his 
                        bedroom. My partner is a police officer. So, I have created him a shelf to put his gear, signs
                        to send my love coming and going to work, a quilt of his favorite things, and a cross-stich sign.

                It is true, Halloween is a lifestyle, not a holiday. After Christmas is over, I start immediately start
                working on decor for Halloween. Each year I try to come up with new costume ideas for my son and myself. If you
                were to walk through my house now, you would see "Halloween" decor. I try to keep it to a minimum throughout
                the house, but my bedroom is awesome.

                        My son was going through an alien stage for a couple of years so I made him two mask to created 
                        the two mask. The skulls are made out of melted milk jugs. I used foam insulation to make the gravestones.
                        The grim reaper is made from drop-clothes and truck bed spray liner. The heart is made from foam and 
                        liquid latex. I use common everyday things to 
                        create all of my Halloween decor.

                        I have created a lot of decorations for Christmas. I used clay, felt, and material to create the 
                        different decorations on our tree. I also sewed all of the stockings. In the movie, they have a 
                        countdown clock indicating how many days left till Halloween, and later Christmas. An finally, I
                        have a lifesize Jack that is 7 feet tall, he is putting deorations on our tree.

                        For Easter, I created a gothic egg tree. It stays up on out mantle year round.I also am in the middle of
                        creating a gothic quilt; so far I have a bat and house. The two light switches are in my bedroom.
                        The wreath is also in my bedroom, all but the frame is from dollar store. The cross-stitch describs me but
                        is a quote from Beetlejuice. I also created the sign Home is where the bodies are buried with my Cricut. 
                        I did have it on my mantle but my daughter pointed out that I also had my mother and aunt's ashes. My
                        daugther pointed out that it could be seen in bad taste. I did not do it on purpose but I think both of 
                        them would of thought it was funny.
